## step for adding the proxy of chrome browser

        To set Burp Suite to use the proxy address 127.0.0.1:8080 on an Ubuntu system, you'll need to configure your system or browser to route traffic through this proxy. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

    Option 1: Set Proxy for the Entire System
    Open the Network Settings:
    
    Click on the network icon in the system tray.
    Select "Settings" or "Network Settings."
    Configure the Proxy:
    
    In the Network settings window, look for "Network Proxy" or similar.
    Select "Manual" for the proxy configuration.
    Set the HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port 8080.
    Leave other fields, like Socks Host, empty unless needed.
    Apply the changes.

    or 

## For Google Chrome:
    Google Chrome uses the system proxy settings. Follow Option 1 to set up the proxy for the entire system.
    
    go to the chrome setting and search **proxy** and then > open you computer proxy setting > it will open your system network setting and do obove steps accordingly... 


    Testing the Proxy:
    After setting up the proxy, open your browser and navigate to any website. Burp Suite should intercept the traffic, allowing you to monitor or modify it as needed.
